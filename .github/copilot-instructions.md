<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a query builder web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The application allows users to visually construct database queries through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS Modules / CSS-in-JS (to be determined)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useReducer)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use descriptive component and variable names
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Write clean, maintainable code with proper separation of concerns

## Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Follow React best practices for performance optimization

## Query Builder Specific Guidelines
- Design intuitive UI components for query construction
- Implement proper validation for query syntax
- Consider different database types and their specific syntax requirements
- Provide clear visual feedback for user actions
- Ensure the generated queries are properly formatted and secure
